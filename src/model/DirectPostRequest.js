/**
 * CityPay Payment API
 *  Welcome to the CityPay API, a robust HTTP API payment solution designed for seamless server-to-server  transactional processing. Our API facilitates a wide array of payment operations, catering to diverse business needs.  Whether you're integrating Internet payments, handling Mail Order/Telephone Order (MOTO) transactions, managing  Subscriptions with Recurring and Continuous Authority payments, or navigating the complexities of 3-D Secure  authentication, our API is equipped to support your requirements. Additionally, we offer functionalities for  Authorisation, Refunding, Pre-Authorisation, Cancellation/Voids, and Completion processing, alongside the capability  for tokenised payments.  ## Compliance and Security Overview <aside class=\"notice\">   Ensuring the security of payment transactions and compliance with industry standards is paramount. Our API is    designed with stringent security measures and compliance protocols to safeguard sensitive information and meet    the rigorous requirements of Visa, MasterCard, and the PCI Security Standards Council. </aside>  ### Key Compliance and Security Measures  * **TLS Encryption**: All data transmissions must utilise TLS version 1.2 or higher, employing [strong cryptography](#enabled-tls-ciphers). Our infrastructure strictly enforces this requirement to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit. We conduct regular scans and assessments of our TLS endpoints to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. * **Data Storage Prohibitions**: Storing sensitive cardholder data (CHD), such as the card security code (CSC) or primary account number (PAN), is strictly prohibited. Our API is designed to minimize your exposure to sensitive data, thereby reducing your compliance burden. * **Data Masking**: For consumer protection and compliance, full card numbers must not be displayed on receipts or any customer-facing materials. Our API automatically masks PANs, displaying only the last four digits to facilitate safe receipt generation. * **Network Scans**: If your application is web-based, regular scans of your hosting environment are mandatory to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities. This proactive measure is crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant online presence. * **PCI Compliance**: Adherence to PCI DSS standards is not optional; it's a requirement for operating securely and legally in the payments ecosystem. For detailed information on compliance requirements and resources, please visit the PCI Security Standards Council website [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). * **Request Validation**: Our API includes mechanisms to verify the legitimacy of each request, ensuring it pertains to a valid account and originates from a trusted source. We leverage remote IP address verification alongside sophisticated application firewall technologies to thwart a wide array of common security threats.  ## Getting Started Before integrating with the CityPay API, ensure your application and development practices align with the outlined compliance and security measures. This preparatory step is crucial for a smooth integration process and the long-term success of your payment processing operations.  For further details on API endpoints, request/response formats, and code examples, proceed to the subsequent sections of our documentation. Our aim is to provide you with all the necessary tools and information to integrate our payment processing capabilities seamlessly into your application.  Thank you for choosing CityPay API. We look forward to supporting your payment processing needs with our secure, compliant, and versatile API solution.

 */
class DirectPostRequest {
    /**
     * Constructs a new <code>DirectPostRequest</code>.
     * @alias module:model/DirectPostRequest
     * @param amount {Number} The amount to authorise in the lowest unit of currency with a variable length to a maximum of 12 digits.  No decimal points are to be included and no divisional characters such as 1,024.  The amount should be the total amount required for the transaction.  For example with GBP £1,021.95 the amount value is 102195. 
     * @param cardnumber {String} The card number (PAN) with a variable length to a maximum of 21 digits in numerical form. Any non numeric characters will be stripped out of the card number, this includes whitespace or separators internal of the provided value.  The card number must be treated as sensitive data. We only provide an obfuscated value in logging and reporting.  The plaintext value is encrypted in our database using AES 256 GMC bit encryption for settlement or refund purposes.  When providing the card number to our gateway through the authorisation API you will be handling the card data on your application. This will require further PCI controls to be in place and this value must never be stored. 
     * @param expmonth {Number} The month of expiry of the card. The month value should be a numerical value between 1 and 12. 
     * @param expyear {Number} The year of expiry of the card. 
     * @param identifier {String} The identifier of the transaction to process. The value should be a valid reference and may be used to perform  post processing actions and to aid in reconciliation of transactions.  The value should be a valid printable string with ASCII character ranges from 0x32 to 0x127.  The identifier is recommended to be distinct for each transaction such as a [random unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) this will aid in ensuring each transaction is identifiable.  When transactions are processed they are also checked for duplicate requests. Changing the identifier on a subsequent request will ensure that a transaction is considered as different. 
     * @param mac {String} A message authentication code ensures the data is authentic and that the intended amount has not been tampered with. The mac value is generated using a hash-based mac value. The following algorithm is used. - A key (k) is derived from your licence key - A value (v) is produced by concatenating the nonce, amount value and identifier, such as a purchase   with nonce `0123456789ABCDEF` an amount of £275.95 and an identifier of OD-12345678 would become   `0123456789ABCDEF27595OD-12345678` and extracting the UTF-8 byte values - The result from HMAC_SHA256(k, v) is hex-encoded (upper-case) - For instance, a licence key of `LK123456789`, a nonce of `0123456789ABCDEF`, an amount of `27595` and an identifier of `OD-12345678`  would generate a MAC of `163DBAB194D743866A9BCC7FC9C8A88FCD99C6BBBF08D619291212D1B91EE12E`.
