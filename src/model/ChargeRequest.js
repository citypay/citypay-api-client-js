/**
 * CityPay Payment API
 *  This CityPay API is a HTTP RESTful payment API used for direct server to server transactional processing. It provides a number of payment mechanisms including: Internet, MOTO, Continuous Authority transaction processing, 3-D Secure decision handling using RFA Secure, Authorisation, Refunding, Pre-Authorisation, Cancellation/Voids and Completion processing. The API is also capable of tokinsed payments using Card Holder Accounts.  ## Compliance and Security <aside class=\"notice\">   Before we begin a reminder that your application will need to adhere to PCI-DSS standards to operate safely   and to meet requirements set out by Visa and MasterCard and the PCI Security Standards Council including: </aside>  * Data must be collected using TLS version 1.2 using [strong cryptography](#enabled-tls-ciphers). We will not accept calls to our API at   lower grade encryption levels. We regularly scan our TLS endpoints for vulnerabilities and perform TLS assessments   as part of our compliance program. * The application must not store sensitive card holder data (CHD) such as the card security code (CSC) or   primary access number (PAN) * The application must not display the full card number on receipts, it is recommended to mask the PAN   and show the last 4 digits. The API will return this for you for ease of receipt creation * If you are developing a website, you will be required to perform regular scans on the network where you host the   application to meet your compliance obligations * You will be required to be PCI Compliant and the application must adhere to the security standard. Further information   is available from [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) * The API verifies that the request is for a valid account and originates from a trusted source using the remote IP   address. Our application firewalls analyse data that may be an attempt to break a large number of security common   security vulnerabilities.

No decimal points are to be included and no divisional characters such as 1,024. The amount should be the total amount required for the transaction. For example with GBP £1,021.95 the amount value is 102195.

The value should be a valid reference and may be used to perform  post processing actions and to aid in reconciliation of transactions.  The value should be a valid printable string with ASCII character ranges from 0x32 to 0x127.  The identifier is recommended to be distinct for each transaction such as a [random unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) this will aid in ensuring each transaction is identifiable.  When transactions are processed they are also checked for duplicate requests. Changing the identifier on a subsequent request will ensure that a transaction is considered as different. 
     * @param merchantid {Number} Identifies the merchant account to perform processing for.
     * @param token {String} A tokenised form of a card that belongs to a card holder's account and that has been previously registered. The token is time based and will only be active for a short duration. The value is therefore designed not to be stored remotely for future  use.  Tokens will start with ct and are resiliently tamper proof using HMacSHA-256. No sensitive card data is stored internally within the token.  Each card will contain a different token and the value may be different on any retrieval call.  The value can be presented for payment as a selection value to an end user in a web application.
