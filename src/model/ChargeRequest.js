/**
 * CityPay Payment API
 *  This CityPay API is a HTTP RESTful payment API used for direct server to server transactional processing. It provides a number of payment mechanisms including: Internet, MOTO, Continuous Authority transaction processing, 3-D Secure decision handling using RFA Secure, Authorisation, Refunding, Pre-Authorisation, Cancellation/Voids and Completion processing. The API is also capable of tokinsed payments using Card Holder Accounts.  ## Compliance and Security Your application will need to adhere to PCI-DSS standards to operate safely and to meet requirements set out by  Visa and MasterCard and the PCI Security Standards Council. These include  * Data must be collected using TLS version 1.2 using [strong cryptography](#enabled-tls-ciphers). We will not accept calls to our API at   lower grade encryption levels. We regularly scan our TLS endpoints for vulnerabilities and perform TLS assessments   as part of our compliance program. * The application must not store sensitive card holder data (CHD) such as the card security code (CSC) or   primary access number (PAN) * The application must not display the full card number on receipts, it is recommended to mask the PAN   and show the last 4 digits. The API will return this for you for ease of receipt creation * If you are developing a website, you will be required to perform regular scans on the network where you host the   application to meet your compliance obligations * You will be required to be PCI Compliant and the application must adhere to the security standard. Further information   is available from [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) * The API verifies that the request is for a valid account and originates from a trusted source using the remote IP   address. Our application firewalls analyse data that may be an attempt to break a large number of security common   security vulnerabilities.

/**
 * Merchant-initiated transactions (MITs) are payments you trigger, where the cardholder has previously consented to you carrying out such payments. These may be scheduled (such as recurring payments and installments) or unscheduled (like account top-ups triggered by balance thresholds and no-show charges).  Scheduled --- These are regular payments using stored card details, like installments or a monthly subscription fee.  - `I` Instalment - A single purchase of goods or services billed to a cardholder in multiple transactions, over a period of time agreed by the cardholder and you.  - `R` Recurring - Transactions processed at fixed, regular intervals not to exceed one year between transactions, representing an agreement between a cardholder and you to purchase goods or services provided over a period of time.  Unscheduled --- These are payments using stored card details that do not occur on a regular schedule, like top-ups for a digital wallet triggered by the balance falling below a certain threshold.  - `A` Reauthorisation - a purchase made after the original purchase. A common scenario is delayed/split shipments.  - `C` Unscheduled Payment - A transaction using a stored credential for a fixed or variable amount that does not occur on a scheduled or regularly occurring transaction date. This includes account top-ups triggered by balance thresholds.  - `D` Delayed Charge - A delayed charge is typically used in hotel, cruise lines and vehicle rental environments to perform a supplemental account charge after original services are rendered.  - `L` Incremental - An incremental authorisation is typically found in hotel and car rental environments, where the cardholder has agreed to pay for any service incurred during the duration of the contract. An incremental authorisation is where you need to seek authorisation of further funds in addition to what you have originally requested. A common scenario is additional services charged to the contract, such as extending a stay in a hotel.  - `S` Resubmission - When the original purchase occurred, but you were not able to get authorisation at the time the goods or services were provided. It should be only used where the goods or services have already been provided, but the authorisation request is declined for insufficient funds.  - `X` No-show - A no-show is a transaction where you are enabled to charge for services which the cardholder entered into an agreement to purchase, but the cardholder did not meet the terms of the agreement.

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) requires that at no stage of a transaction should the CSC be stored.  This applies to all entities handling card data.  It should also not be used in any hashing process.  CityPay do not store the value and have no method of retrieving the value once the transaction has been processed.
