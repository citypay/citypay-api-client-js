/**
 * CityPay Payment API
 *  Welcome to the CityPay API, a robust HTTP API payment solution designed for seamless server-to-server  transactional processing. Our API facilitates a wide array of payment operations, catering to diverse business needs.  Whether you're integrating Internet payments, handling Mail Order/Telephone Order (MOTO) transactions, managing  Subscriptions with Recurring and Continuous Authority payments, or navigating the complexities of 3-D Secure  authentication, our API is equipped to support your requirements. Additionally, we offer functionalities for  Authorisation, Refunding, Pre-Authorisation, Cancellation/Voids, and Completion processing, alongside the capability  for tokenised payments.  ## Compliance and Security Overview <aside class=\"notice\">   Ensuring the security of payment transactions and compliance with industry standards is paramount. Our API is    designed with stringent security measures and compliance protocols to safeguard sensitive information and meet    the rigorous requirements of Visa, MasterCard, and the PCI Security Standards Council. </aside>  ### Key Compliance and Security Measures  * **TLS Encryption**: All data transmissions must utilise TLS version 1.2 or higher, employing [strong cryptography](#enabled-tls-ciphers). Our infrastructure strictly enforces this requirement to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit. We conduct regular scans and assessments of our TLS endpoints to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. * **Data Storage Prohibitions**: Storing sensitive cardholder data (CHD), such as the card security code (CSC) or primary account number (PAN), is strictly prohibited. Our API is designed to minimize your exposure to sensitive data, thereby reducing your compliance burden. * **Data Masking**: For consumer protection and compliance, full card numbers must not be displayed on receipts or any customer-facing materials. Our API automatically masks PANs, displaying only the last four digits to facilitate safe receipt generation. * **Network Scans**: If your application is web-based, regular scans of your hosting environment are mandatory to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities. This proactive measure is crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant online presence. * **PCI Compliance**: Adherence to PCI DSS standards is not optional; it's a requirement for operating securely and legally in the payments ecosystem. For detailed information on compliance requirements and resources, please visit the PCI Security Standards Council website [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). * **Request Validation**: Our API includes mechanisms to verify the legitimacy of each request, ensuring it pertains to a valid account and originates from a trusted source. We leverage remote IP address verification alongside sophisticated application firewall technologies to thwart a wide array of common security threats.  ## Getting Started Before integrating with the CityPay API, ensure your application and development practices align with the outlined compliance and security measures. This preparatory step is crucial for a smooth integration process and the long-term success of your payment processing operations.  For further details on API endpoints, request/response formats, and code examples, proceed to the subsequent sections of our documentation. Our aim is to provide you with all the necessary tools and information to integrate our payment processing capabilities seamlessly into your application.  Thank you for choosing CityPay API. We look forward to supporting your payment processing needs with our secure, compliant, and versatile API solution.

    /**
     * Create Bill Payment Paylink Token
     * CityPay Paylink supports invoice and bill payment services by allowing merchants to raise an invoice in their systems and associate the invoice with a Paylink checkout token. CityPay will co-ordinate the checkout flow in relationship with your customer. Our bill payment solution may be used to streamline the payment flow with cardholders to allow your invoice to be paid promptly and via multiple payment channels such as Card Payment, Apple Pay or Google Pay.  The bill payment service allows  1. setting up notification paths to an end customer, such as SMS or Email 2. enabling attachments to be included with Paylink tokens 3. produce chaser notifications for unpaid invoices 4. provide callbacks for notification of the payment of an invoice 5. support part payments against an invoice 6. support of field guards to protect the payment screen 7. support of status reporting on tokens 8. URL short codes for SMS notifications  <img src=\"images/merchant-BPS-workflow.png\" alt=\"Paylink BPSv2 Overview\" width=\"50%\"/>    ### Notification Paths  Notification paths can be provided which identify the channels for communication of the invoice availability. Up to 3 notification paths may be provided per request.  Each notification uses a template to generate the body of the message. This allows for variable text to be sent out and customised for each call.  SMS messages use URL Short Codes (USC) as a payment link to the invoice payment page. This allows for a standard payment URL to be shortened for optimised usage in SMS. For instance a URL of `https://checkout.citypay.com/PL1234/s348yb8yna4a48n2f8nq2f3msgyng-psn348ynaw8ynaw/en` becomes `citypay.com/Za48na3x`. Each USC is unique however it is a requirement that each USC generated is protected with Field Guards to ensure that sensitive data (such as customer contact details and GDPR) is protected.  To send a notification path, append a `notification-path` property to the request.  ```json  {   \"sms_notification_path\": {       \"to\": \"+441534884000\"   },   \"email_notification_path\": {       \"to\": [\"help-desk@citypay.com\"],       \"cc\": [\"third-party@citypay.com\"],       \"reply\": [\"help@my-company.com\"]   } } ```  Notification paths trigger a number of events which are stored as part of the timeline of events of a Paylink token  - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationQueued` - identifies when an SMS notification has been queued for delivery - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationSent` - identifies when an SMS notification has been sent to the upstream network - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationDelivered` - identifies when an SMS notification has been delivered as notified by the upstream network - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationUndelivered` - identifies when an SMS notification has undelivered notification is provided by the upstream network - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationFailure` - identifies when an SMS notification has failed - `BillPaymentEmailNotificationQueued` -  identifies when an email notification has been queued for delivery - `BillPaymentEmailNotificationSent` -  identifies when an email notification has been accepted by our SMS forwarder - `BillPaymentEmailNotificationFailure` - identifies when an email notification has failed delivery   #### SMS Notification Path  SMS originated from a CityPay pool of numbers and by default only sends to country codes where the service is registered. SMSs may contain a From field which is configured as part of you onboarding and have a name associated to identify the service origin. For example if your business is titled `Health Surgery Ltd` the SMS may be sent to originate from `Health Surgery`.   SMS is also configured for a \"polite mode\". This mode ensures that SMSs aren't sent in the middle of the night when backend services ordinarily run. SMSs will be queued until the time range is deemed as polite. Normally this is between 8am and 9pm.  | Field    | Type     | Usage    | Description                                                                                     | |----------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | template | string   | Reserved | An optional template name to use a template other than the default.                             | | to       | string   | Reserved | The phone number in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format to send the message to. |  #### Email Notification Paths  | Field    | Type     | Usage    | Description                                                                                     | |----------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | template | string   | Reserved | An optional template name to use a template other than the default.                             | | to       | string[] | Required | An array of email addresses to be used for delivery. A maximum of 5 addresses can be added.     | | cc       | string[] | Required | An array of email addresses to be used for cc delivery. A maximum of 5 addresses can be added.  | | bcc      | string[] | Required | An array of email addresses to be used for bcc delivery. A maximum of 5 addresses can be added. | | reply_to | string[] | Required | An array of email addresses to be used for the Reply-To header of an email.     |   ### Field Guards  To ensure that invoices are paid by the intended recipient, Paylink supports the addition of Field Guards.  A Field Guard is an intended field which is to be used as a form of guarded authentication. More than 1 field can be requested.  <img src=\"images/paylink-field-guards.png\" alt=\"Paylink Field Guards\" width=\"50%\"/>  To determine the source value of the field, each field name is searched in the order of  - identifier - cardholder data such as name - custom parameters - pass through data  If no field values are found, the token request returns a D041 validation error.  #### Authentication and Validation  When values are entered by the user, resultant comparisons are performed by  1. Transliteration of both the source value and entered value. For example, names with accents (e.g. é will become e) 2. Only Alphanumeric values are retained any whitespace or special characters are ignored 3. Case is ignored  Should all values match, the user is authenticated and can continue to the payment form rendered by the Paylink server.  On successful login, an event will be added to include that the access guard validated access.  #### Access-Key  To ensure that a user does not need to re-enter these values multiple times, a cookie is pushed to the user’s browser with an access-key digest value. This value will be presented to the server on each refresh therefore allowing the guard to accept the call. Each value is uniquely stored per merchant account and cannot be shared cross merchant. The lifetime of the cookie is set to 24 hours.  #### Brute Force Prevention  To prevent multiple calls hitting the server, attempting a brute force attack, the login process  1. is fronted by a contemporary web application firewall 2. creates an event for each token when access was denied 3. should the number of failed events breach more than 5 in 30 minutes, the token is locked for an hour 4. should the number of events breach more than 20 the token is fully locked  ### Attachments  Attachments can be included in the request in 2 ways  1. Via a data element direct in the request 2. Via a URL upload to a provided pre-signed URL  The decision of which option is dependent on the size of the attachments. Should the attachment size be greater than 32kb a URL upload is required. Small attachments can be included in the JSON request. This is to prevent our web firewall from blocking your request and to also ensure efficiency of larger file uploads.  There is a maximum of 3 attachments that can be added to a request.  ```json     [{       \"filename\": \"invoice1.pdf\",       \"mime-type\": \"application/pdf\"     },{       \"filename\": \"invoice2.pdf\",       \"data\": \"b4sE64Enc0dEd...=\",       \"mime-type\": \"application/pdf\"     }] ```  | Field     | Type   | Usage    | Description                                                                                                                                          | |-----------|--------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | filename  | string | Required | The name of the attachment normally taken from the filename.

To send a notification path, append a `notification-path` property to the request.  ```json  {   \"sms_notification_path\": {       \"to\": \"+441534884000\"   },   \"email_notification_path\": {       \"to\": [\"help-desk@citypay.com\"],       \"cc\": [\"third-party@citypay.com\"],       \"reply\": [\"help@my-company.com\"]   } } ```  Notification paths trigger a number of events which are stored as part of the timeline of events of a Paylink token  - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationQueued` - identifies when an SMS notification has been queued for delivery - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationSent` - identifies when an SMS notification has been sent to the upstream network - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationDelivered` - identifies when an SMS notification has been delivered as notified by the upstream network - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationUndelivered` - identifies when an SMS notification has undelivered notification is provided by the upstream network - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationFailure` - identifies when an SMS notification has failed - `BillPaymentEmailNotificationQueued` -  identifies when an email notification has been queued for delivery - `BillPaymentEmailNotificationSent` -  identifies when an email notification has been accepted by our SMS forwarder - `BillPaymentEmailNotificationFailure` - identifies when an email notification has failed delivery   #### SMS Notification Path  SMS originated from a CityPay pool of numbers and by default only sends to country codes where the service is registered. SMSs may contain a From field which is configured as part of you onboarding and have a name associated to identify the service origin. For example if your business is titled `Health Surgery Ltd` the SMS may be sent to originate from `Health Surgery`.   SMS is also configured for a \"polite mode\". This mode ensures that SMSs aren't sent in the middle of the night when backend services ordinarily run. SMSs will be queued until the time range is deemed as polite. Normally this is between 8am and 9pm.  | Field    | Type     | Usage    | Description                                                                                     | |----------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | template | string   | Reserved | An optional template name to use a template other than the default.                             | | to       | string   | Reserved | The phone number in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format to send the message to. |  #### Email Notification Paths  | Field    | Type     | Usage    | Description                                                                                     | |----------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | template | string   | Reserved | An optional template name to use a template other than the default.                             | | to       | string[] | Required | An array of email addresses to be used for delivery. A maximum of 5 addresses can be added.     | | cc       | string[] | Required | An array of email addresses to be used for cc delivery. A maximum of 5 addresses can be added.  | | bcc      | string[] | Required | An array of email addresses to be used for bcc delivery. A maximum of 5 addresses can be added. | | reply_to | string[] | Required | An array of email addresses to be used for the Reply-To header of an email.     |   ### Field Guards  To ensure that invoices are paid by the intended recipient, Paylink supports the addition of Field Guards.  A Field Guard is an intended field which is to be used as a form of guarded authentication. More than 1 field can be requested.  <img src=\"images/paylink-field-guards.png\" alt=\"Paylink Field Guards\" width=\"50%\"/>  To determine the source value of the field, each field name is searched in the order of  - identifier - cardholder data such as name - custom parameters - pass through data  If no field values are found, the token request returns a D041 validation error.  #### Authentication and Validation  When values are entered by the user, resultant comparisons are performed by  1. Transliteration of both the source value and entered value. For example, names with accents (e.g. é will become e) 2. Only Alphanumeric values are retained any whitespace or special characters are ignored 3. Case is ignored  Should all values match, the user is authenticated and can continue to the payment form rendered by the Paylink server.  On successful login, an event will be added to include that the access guard validated access.  #### Access-Key  To ensure that a user does not need to re-enter these values multiple times, a cookie is pushed to the user’s browser with an access-key digest value. This value will be presented to the server on each refresh therefore allowing the guard to accept the call. Each value is uniquely stored per merchant account and cannot be shared cross merchant. The lifetime of the cookie is set to 24 hours.  #### Brute Force Prevention  To prevent multiple calls hitting the server, attempting a brute force attack, the login process  1. is fronted by a contemporary web application firewall 2. creates an event for each token when access was denied 3. should the number of failed events breach more than 5 in 30 minutes, the token is locked for an hour 4. should the number of events breach more than 20 the token is fully locked  ### Attachments  Attachments can be included in the request in 2 ways  1. Via a data element direct in the request 2. Via a URL upload to a provided pre-signed URL  The decision of which option is dependent on the size of the attachments. Should the attachment size be greater than 32kb a URL upload is required. Small attachments can be included in the JSON request. This is to prevent our web firewall from blocking your request and to also ensure efficiency of larger file uploads.  There is a maximum of 3 attachments that can be added to a request.  ```json     [{       \"filename\": \"invoice1.pdf\",       \"mime-type\": \"application/pdf\"     },{       \"filename\": \"invoice2.pdf\",       \"data\": \"b4sE64Enc0dEd...=\",       \"mime-type\": \"application/pdf\"     }] ```  | Field     | Type   | Usage    | Description                                                                                                                                          | |-----------|--------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | filename  | string | Required | The name of the attachment normally taken from the filename.
